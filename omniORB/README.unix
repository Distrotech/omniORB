If this is a pre-compiled binary distribution, the binaries are located in the
following directories:

./lib                             : static and shared libraries
./bin                             : executables


Configuration
=============

There are two ways to configure omniORB. The easiest is usually to use
the Autoconf configure script; if that fails, or you have a good
reason, manual configuration based on platform files is possible.


Autoconf configuration
======================

On most Unix platforms, omniORB can be configured using the common
Autoconf configure script, that tries to figure out the specifics of
your machine.

The Autoconf build does not currently work for cross compiling.

Although you can run configure and make in the main omniORB source
directory, you are strongly advised to build in a different
directory. e.g.

  $ cd $OMNIORB_TOP
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ ../configure [configure options]
  $ make
  $ make install

That keeps the build files separate from the source files, and allows
you to have several parallel builds.

configure options
-----------------

Run configure --help to get a list of configuration options. Most
options are standard Autoconf ones. The most commonly required is
--prefix, used to select the install location. The default is
/usr/local. To change it, use, for example

  ../configure --prefix=/home/fred/omni_inst

The configure script tries to figure out the location of the C and C++
compilers and Python. It will always choose gcc over the platform's
native compiler if it is available. To change the choices it makes,
use variables CC, CXX and PYTHON, e.g.:

  ../configure CXX=/usr/bin/platform_c++ PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python2.3

There are various omniORB specific options:

  --disable-static   disables the build of static libraries, which
                     shortens the build process.

  --enable-thread-tracing
                     Turns on thread and mutex tracing that can help
                     track down threading bugs in omniORB, but gives a
                     significant performance hit.

                     In some beta releases, thread tracing is turned
                     on by default, so you may wish to turn it off
                     with --disable-thread-tracing.

  --with-openssl=    Specify a location to find the OpenSSL
                     installation, required by the SSL transport.

  --with-omniORB-config=
                     Location to look for the omniORB configuration
                     file. Default /etc/omniORB.cfg

  --with-omniNames-logdir=
                     Location for omniNames' log files. Default
                     /var/omninames.


Once omniORB is configured, build it with "make", then install it with
"make install". You must use GNU make.


Configuring the Naming service
==============================

You also have to configure the omniORB runtime and the naming service,
consult the user guides in ./doc for details. For a quick start,
follow these steps:

    o Set the environment variable OMNINAMES_LOGDIR to a directory where
      the naming service omniNames can store its data. For example:
          OMNINAMES_LOGDIR=/wib/wob; export OMNINAMES_LOGDIR

    o Start omniNames.
         $ omniNames -start &

    o Create a file omniORB.cfg, based on sample.cfg. It should
      contain a line of the form

        InitRef = NameService=corbaname::my.host.name

    o Set the environment variable OMNIORB_CONFIG to contain the full
      path name of the file omniORB.cfg. For example,
          OMNIORB_CONFIG=/wib/wob/omniORB.cfg; export OMNIORB_CONFIG


Building the examples
=====================

You are strongly encouraged to try out the examples provided in the
src/examples directory. To build them, go into the src/examples
directory (within the build tree if you are using an Autoconf separate
build tree) and do "make".

Study the documentation in ./doc before you run any of the example
programs.


Writing your own Makefile
=========================

The distribution makefiles may be a bit much to digest.
Here is a few tips of what to put into your makefiles to compile omniORB
programs:

1. Compiler flags:

To compile omniORB programs correctly, several C++ preprocessor defines
must be specified to identify the target platform. With an Autoconf
based build, the file include/omniconfig.h sets the defines for you,
so you do not need to explicitly set anything. With non-Autoconf
builds, you must set the following processor defines:

Sun Solaris 2.5     |__sparc__  __sunos__     __OSVERSION__=5            |
Digital Unix 3.2    |__alpha__  __osf1__      __OSVERSION__=3            |
HPUX 10.x           |__hppa__   __hpux__      __OSVERSION__=10           |
HPUX 11.x           |__hppa__   __hpux__      __OSVERSION__=11           |
IBM AIX 4.x &       |__aix__    __powerpc__   __OSVERSION__=4            |
Linux 2.0 (x86)     |__x86__    __linux__     __OSVERSION__=2            |
Linux 2.0 (alpha)   |__alpha__  __linux__     __OSVERSION__=2            |
Windows/NT 3.5      |__x86__    __NT__        __OSVERSION__=3  __WIN32__ |
Windows/NT 4.0      |__x86__    __NT__        __OSVERSION__=4  __WIN32__ |
Windows 2000        |__x86__    __NT__        __OSVERSION__=5  __WIN32__ |
Windows 95          |__x86__    __WIN32__                                |
OpenVMS 6.x (alpha) |__alpha__  __vms         __OSVERSION__=6            |
OpenVMS 6.x (vax)   |__vax__    __vms         __OSVERSION__=6            |
ATMos 4.0           |__arm__    __atmos__     __OSVERSION__=4            |
NextStep 3.x        |__m68k__   __nextstep__  __OSVERSION__=3            |
Unixware 7          |__x86__    __uw7__       __OSVERSION__=5            |

You should also specify the preprocessor defines (e.g. -D_REENTRANT) for
compiling multithreaded programs.


2. Libraries:

The runtime libraries that you have to link to your executables are
usually:

libomnithread.so    - omnithread shared library
libomniORB4.so      - omniORB runtime shared library
libomniDynamic4.so  - omniORB runtime shared library for dynamic features
libomniCodeSets4.so - extra code sets for string transformation
libomnisslTP.so     - SSL transport (built if OpenSSL is available)
libCOS4.so          - stubs and skeletons for the COS service interfaces
libCOSDynamic4.so   - dynamic stubs for the COS service interfaces

The name of the libraries may be have different suffixes on different
platforms. You can figure it out.

3. IDL compiler:

IDL stubs can be compiled like this:

  omniidl -bcxx echo.idl

The product is the files: echo.hh and echoSK.cc


Documentation
=============

You must read the omniORB and the naming service user guides. Follow
the instructions in the guides to complete the configuration process.


Manual configuration with platform files
========================================

Ignore this section unless you are absolutely certain that you should
be using the old build environment.

To build using the old omniORB build environment, follow these steps:
 
  1. Select the appropriate platform configuration file
  ------------------------------------------------------

  Edit ./config/config.mk to select the appropriate platform file

      e.g. For Solaris 2.5 onwards and with Sunspro C++
      
            platform = sun4_sosV_5.5

  All the platform files are in ./mk/platforms.

  If you are using gcc or the default compiler for your platform is
  gcc, it is most likely that you have to edit the CXX and CC make
  variables in the platform file. Some old versions of gcc do not have
  proper support for multithreaded exception handling, and thus cannot
  be used for omniORB. Moreover, the gcc compiler has to be configured
  with the --enable-threads option or else the code generated does not
  work reliably. The default version of gcc compiler that comes with
  your platform may not be the right version.


  2. Set the location of a Python interpreter
  -------------------------------------------

  Edit ./mk/platforms/<platform>.mk, where <platform> is the platform
  name you set in config.mk.

  Uncomment the 'PYTHON =' line, and set it to the path of your Python
  interpreter.

  If you do not have Python 1.5.2 or higher, you can download the full
  source distribution from

   http://www.python.org/download/


  3. Building and installing
  --------------------------

  The makefiles in this distribution only work with GNU make. Make
  sure that you have the program installed and invoke it directly.

  To build and install everything, go into the directory ./src and
  type 'make export'. If all goes well, the libraries and executables
  will be installed into ./lib/<platform>/ and ./bin/<platform>/.


  4. Add omniORB libraries to search path
  ---------------------------------------

  Since the shared libraries libomniORB4.so and libomnithread.so are not in
  the directories searched by the dynamic loader by default, you must add 
  the library directory to the search path. For example:
 
    On Solaris 2.5
       $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<absolute pathname of ./lib/sun4_sosV_5.5>
       $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
