---------------------------

To be written.


Known issues
------------

This release has the following known issues and omissions:

 - There is no support for DII and DSI. Since you can write IDL and
   Python code on-the-fly, this is not a significant limitation.

 - Interceptors have only limited functionality, and do not adhere to
   the portable interceptors API.

 - Local interfaces are not supported for user-defined IDL.
